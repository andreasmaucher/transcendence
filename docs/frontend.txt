Vite in the context of building is allowed:

TypeScript doesn't run in browsers, it must be compiled in JavaScript. Node.js is the local runtime used to run the compiler and dev tools.
Vite is a tool that compiles the TypeScript & bundles modules. It is not part of the frontend code!

## Dependency lockfiles
- package.json: declares dependencies (version ranges).
- package-lock.json: exact versions resolved by npm for reproducible installs. Auto-generated; commit it, don’t edit by hand.
- To refresh: delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run `npm install`.

## TypeScript configuration
- `tsconfig.json` defines how TypeScript analyzes the project.
- Key points:
  - `target` ES2020, `module` ESNext, `lib` includes `DOM` (browser types)
  - `moduleResolution: Bundler` to align with Vite
  - `strict: true` for safer types
  - `noEmit: true` (Vite handles build output)
- Adjust `jsx` if using React; otherwise it’s harmless or can be set to `"preserve"`.
