containerization -> Dockerfile

winning score is handled very specifically and certain cases might be confusing.
-> probably better to simplify

backend:
- extract constants into env file for easier manageability
Keep constants.ts for now - frontend still needs it for rendering, and you need to sync the values with backend!
- score.ts connect to a database and update player scores (currently only placeholders)
